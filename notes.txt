Joint 4 on the arm is reversed, thus I had to negate its position. This fixed
a lot of the issues.
Most of the times when the inverse kinematics converges on a solution, the
angles are NOT in the range [-pi, pi]. Try writing an angle wrap function to
make all angles go to -pi, pi.
Also add a smarter heuristic to catch when the inverse kinematic solution fails.
Finally, make the angle speeds constant so that the movement is smooth.
